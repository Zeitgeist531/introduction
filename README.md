# About Me

Hello there! My name is Yuanyuan Chen, and I come from a unique background that blends Communication Studies with Data Analytics. Currently, I am navigating through my second semester of graduate studies, where I'm diving deeper into the complexities of data analytics skills and I also want to explore more programming skills.

I am thrilled to be a part of this Java Bootcamp, which is specifically designed for women. It's an exciting opportunity for me to enhance my technical skills.

I look forward to connecting with fellow participants and mentors throughout this program. Let's embark on this learning journey together!
